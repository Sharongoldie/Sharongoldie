Hey there, fellow code explorer! 🚀✨

I'm Sharon Mutrie, the creative mind who traded interior design blueprints for coding adventures. Imagine a world where pixels are my paintbrush, and code is my canvas – that's the realm I'm diving into as an aspiring front-end developer!

Join me on this rollercoaster of transformation, where the syntax is my language, and bugs are just unexpected design features. 🐛💻 I've set sail on a self-teaching journey to master the art of front-end wizardry, and my repositories are like treasure chests full of the projects that map out my coding expedition.

Dive in, and you'll find a collection of tech tales where I've danced with various programming languages and tech wonders. From HTML to CSS, JavaScript to the mysteries of frameworks, it's a colorful journey that I'm eager to share!

Why am I on this quest, you ask? Well, my compass is pointed towards the dream of landing a Frontend Developer gig at a top-notch company. 🌟 So, as I juggle with divs and sprinkle a bit of magic with every line of code, I'm on a mission to turn this dream into a reality.

Ready to join me on this coding carnival? Explore my repos, drop a message, or let's just geek out about the wonders of the tech universe. 🎉💻 Exciting times ahead, and I'm thrilled to have you along for the ride!

Cheers to coding, creativity, and making the digital world a more colorful place! 🌈🚀
